# NAME

Dancer::Plugin::Showterm - Replay terminal typescript captures

# VERSION

version 0.0.1

# SYNOPSIS

In `config.yml`:

    plugins:
        Showterm:
            stylesheet: /my_showterm.css

In your app:

    package MyApp;
    use Dancer ':syntax';

    use Dancer::Plugin::Showterm;

    ...

# DESCRIPTION

This plugin is a [Dancer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer) port of the wonderful [http://showterm.io](http://showterm.io), which allows
terminal screen captures taken via the UNIX tool [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/script.1.html|script](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/script.1.html|script) to be 
replayed in the browser. 

The plugin will intercept any request for files with a `.showterm` extension and will generate an
html page that will be able to replay the same file, but with the `.typescript` extension.

In other words, if you put the file `mysession.typescript` in the `public` folder of the app, then the
url `/mysession.showterm` will display its webified version. The webified version can also be embedded in other 
pages via iframes:

        <iframe src="/mysession.showterm" 
                width="660" height="360" style="border: 1px solid #444">
        </iframe>

# CAPTURING THE ACTION

The cli capture is done using the UNIX utility c<script>. 
The plugin assumes that the captured screen is 80 columns by 24 rows.

    $ script -ttiming
    ... everything you do here will be recorded ...
    ^D  
    $ echo '---' | cat - timing >> typescript
    $ mv typescript /path/to/dancer/app/public/myscreen.typescript

Note that the c<typescript> file the plugin uses is the concatenation of the
original produced typescript with its timing file, separated with a type dash 
on a single line.

# ADDED ROUTES

## /showterm/\*

The plugin adds the javascript and stylesheets assets required by the 
webified typescript under `/showterm`.  Those are bundled with the plugin as shared tarball.
If you want to see where this tarball is on your filesystem, you can do

    use Dancer;
    use Dancer::Plugin::Showterm;

    print Dancer::Plugin::Showterm->instance->assets_dir;

or

    $ perl -MFile::ShareDir=dist_dir -E'say dist_dir("Dancer-Plugin-Showterm")'

## \*.showterm

Any request for a file with the extension `.showterm` will be served the showterm
page, using the same uri with its extension changed to `.typescript` as the script to play.

# CONFIGURATION

    plugins:
        Showterm:
            stylesheet: /my_showterm.css
